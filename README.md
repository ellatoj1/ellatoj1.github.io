# Swedish Transport Agency Vehicle and User Management System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for the Swedish Transport Agency (Trafikverket) that enables the monitoring, management, and updating of information regarding vehicles and their owners. The system will also provide user-friendly functions for citizens to manage their vehicle and personal information.

## User Stories

### For the Swedish Transport Agency

**Overview User Story:**

As the Swedish Transport Agency, we want a system that enables us to monitor, manage, and update information on vehicles and their owners, including adding and removing both cars and users, as well as automatically populating the database with example data, to ensure that our database is current, accurate, and useful for our operational needs.

**Detailed Requirements:**

- We want to monitor all cars registered by citizens so that we have a complete list of vehicles and their owners in our database.
- We want to review detailed information about a specific car and its owner so that we can efficiently handle vehicle-related inquiries or investigations.
- We want to update the information on a specific car to ensure that our database always contains the latest and most accurate information.
- We want to make small changes to a car's information without having to update all the data, so that we can quickly and easily correct specific details.
- We want to remove a car from our register to ensure that our database only contains active and relevant vehicle information.
- We want to add a new car to our database so that we can keep an up-to-date record of all new vehicles owned by citizens.
